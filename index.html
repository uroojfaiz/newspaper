    <img src="./download (30).jpeg" >
    <p>In 2025, Artificial Intelligence has become a full partner in the development process, not just a helper. Companies are using <b>AI to automatically generate code, debug errors, and even suggest entire project architectures. </b><span id="extracontant" class="span1">Startups and enterprises alike are reporting faster release cycles, as AI tools reduce weeks of coding into just a few days.
However, experts caution that this partnership must be balanced: human developers remain essential for logic, creativity, and ethical decision-making. Industry insiders call this the era of “hybrid teams”—humans and AI working side by side.</span> <span id="readmore"> Read More </span></p>

        <img src="./download (29).jpeg" >
        <p>Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott has introduced a concept called the <b> “agentic web”—a smarter, </b>AI-powered internet where websites themselves can act like agents. Using the <b>Model Context Protocol (MCP), </b>  websites and apps will soon host their own AI assistants, allowing users to interact in natural language. <span id="extracontant1"  class="span2">Imagine asking a shopping website, “Find me eco-friendly shoes under $100,” and the AI not only searches but negotiates discounts and completes the purchase. Microsoft believes this will reshape search engines, online shopping, and customer support. But with power comes responsibility—experts warn of privacy and security risks if AI agents gain too much autonomy.</span><span id="readmore1"> Read More </span></p>

        <img src="./download (27).jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Sridhar Vembu, founder of Zoho, has sparked debate in the tech community by questioning whether <b>classic programming languages</b> will remain relevant in an AI-first world. With AI tools writing code in natural language prompts, the need for direct use of <b> JavaScript, C, or HTML/CSS </b>may decline. <span id="extracontant2"  class="span3">Yet many developers argue that these languages form the backbone of the web, and AI itself depends on them behind the scenes. Rather than replacing them, experts predict a shift in roles: future developers may rely less on syntax memorization and more on AI-assisted design, logic, and problem-solving.</span> <span id="readmore2"> Read More

        <img src="./download (28).jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The JavaScript ecosystem continues to boom in 2025, with new tools focused on  <b>speed and performance.</b>

<b>Porffor,</b> an ahead-of-time compiler for AWS Lambda, reduces cold start times to under 1 millisecond—ideal for high-speed serverless applications. <span id="extracontant3"  class="span4"> <b>Rspack’s Rslint, </b> a new linter built in Go, offers lightning-fast analysis for JavaScript and TypeScript. Meanwhile, Oxlint, written in Rust, introduces type-aware linting for even smarter code checks.

Legacy developers also have reason to celebrate as  <b>jQuery 4.0 Release Candidate 1 </b>has been launched, proving that even classic tools can find a place in the modern web.</span> <span id="readmore3">Read More</span></p>
